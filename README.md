Legit doesn't get any simpler than this!

A straight forward static file server that can be used to serve files
over HTTP during developement. Useful for one-off and quick file-serving.
> This is not indented to replace a Apache, NGINX, or any proper CDN.
> Use proper production best practices outside of local development and
> iteration.
